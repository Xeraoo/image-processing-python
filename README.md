# Image Processing with Python

This project demonstrates image processing techniques using Python, including image loading, conversion to NumPy arrays, manipulation, and visualization.


## Introduction
In this project, we utilize the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and NumPy to perform various image processing tasks. This includes loading an image from a URL, converting it into a NumPy array, and performing manipulations such as cropping and modifying pixel values. The project also includes visualizing the original and modified images, as well as their histograms for analysis.
